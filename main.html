	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Becoming a developer gives me a way to turn ideas into useful products, learn constantly, and do impactful work while enjoying flexibility and strong long‑term career prospects.​

What drives me
I love solving problems and building things end‑to‑end, from a concept to a polished user experience that people actually use.​

Writing clean, maintainable code and iterating on design is creatively satisfying and intellectually challenging.​

How I grow
The field evolves fast, so I’m motivated by continuous learning across frameworks, cloud, and AI, which keeps me engaged and expanding my skill set.​

That learning opens doors to new roles and domains over time, giving me a dynamic, durable career path.​

The impact I want
Software touches healthcare, finance, education, and daily life, and I want my work to improve performance, accessibility, and user outcomes.​

Shipping features that solve real user problems gives me a tangible sense of purpose and contribution.</p>
